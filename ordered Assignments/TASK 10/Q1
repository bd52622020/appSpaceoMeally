1. Write a Python program to remove consecutive duplicates of a given list. 
Orignal list: 
[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4] 
After removing consecutive duplicates: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4] 

x = [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 4]
c =[]
for i in x:
    if i not in c:
        c.append(i)
x=c

print(x)
