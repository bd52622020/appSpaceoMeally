3. Write a Python program to find numbers divisible by nineteen or thirteen from a list of numbers using Lambda.] 

n = [19, 65, 57, 39, 152, 639, 121, 44, 90, 190]
print("Chosen list:")
print(n)
r = list(filter(lambda x: (x % 19 == 0 or x % 13 == 0), n))
print("\nNumbers of the above list divisible by nineteen or thirteen:")
print(r)
