4. Write a password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your code in a main method.

import random

num = 1
length = input('Enter the length of you password: ')
length = int(length)
keys = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@Â£$%^&*().,?0123456789'

print('Your password is:')

for i in range(num):
  password = ''
  for j in range(length):
    password += random.choice(keys)
  print(password)
