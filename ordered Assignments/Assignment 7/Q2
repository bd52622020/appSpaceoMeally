Read a file in python, 
Use Try, Exception and Finally block to execute pieces of code
check if it exists 
If it exists print out the first 10 lines 
If it does not exist print on console “the file does not exist”  
#The code here is working but I cant see any results to optimise it because my IDE is not operating properlt for open funtion and regex.
# I am able to get it to run now and I will try to fix the other issues tomorrow.

try:
    f = open('Pandas.txt', 'r+')
    for i in range(10):
        print(f.readline())
    f.close()
except FileNotFoundError as error:
    print('File not found')
    if error:
        print('A new file is created')
        f = open('Pandas.txt', 'w+')
