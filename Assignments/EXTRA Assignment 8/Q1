1) Write a function that prints all the prime numbers between 0 and limit where limit is a parameter. 
lower = 0
upper = int(input( 'Input a number > '))

print("Prime numbers between", lower, "and", upper, "are:")
def prime(lower, upper ):
    for n in range(lower, upper + 1):
       # all prime numbers are greater than 1
       if n > 1:
           for i in range(2, n):
               if (n % i) == 0:
                   break
           else:
               print(n)

prime(lower, upper)
