1. What is the purpose local or local[*] in a scala code ? 
This is to run spark locally with as many worker threads as logical cores on a machine. The code you have given will specify a master url for a local to run run locally with all the threads on your machine

2. What is the difference between map and flatMap ? 
Map returns only oneelement whilst FlatMap can return a list of elements as an itereator.

3. What are two fundamental methods of creating a RDD in spark ? 
- In the initial stage when we learn Spark, RDDs are generally created by parallelized collection i.e. by taking an existing collection in the program and passing it to SparkContextâ€™s parallelize() method.
- Transformation mutates one RDD into another RDD, thus transformation is the way to create an RDD from already existing RDD. This creates difference between Apache Spark and Hadoop MapReduce. 

4. What is the difference between map and mapValues ? 
MapValues is only applicable for PairRDDs, meaning RDDs of the form RDD[(A, B)]. In that case, mapValues operates on the value only (the second part of the tuple), while map operates on the entire record (tuple of key and value).

5. What transformation helps us summarize data according to a key ?
