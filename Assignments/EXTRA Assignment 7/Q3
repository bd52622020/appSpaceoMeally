Create a function that finds the range of a triangle's third edge, given the side lengths of first two parameters
a = int(input('Input side a >: '))
b = int(input('Input side b >: '))

def tri(a, b):

    if a>b:
        lowerb = a-b
        Upperb = b+a
        print(f'Triangle side c range is between {lowerb} and {Upperb}')
    elif b>a:
        lowerb = b-a
        Upperb = b+a
        print(f'Triangle side c range is between {lowerb} and {Upperb}')

tri(a,b)
