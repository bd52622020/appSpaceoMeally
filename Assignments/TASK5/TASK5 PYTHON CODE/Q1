Q1) Write a password generator in Python. 
Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. Include your code in a main method.

import random

s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!@Â£$%^&*().,?0123456789'
num = 1
length = int(input('Enter the length of your password: '))
print('\nPasswords: ')

for pwd in range(num):
  password = ''
  for i in range(length):
    password += random.choice(s)
  print(password)
